I am a postdoctoral scholar at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics. My research aims to understand the quantum physics at boundaries of various kinds. This includes the [celestial hologram](https://simonscelestialholographycollaboration.org/) at the asymptotic boundary of flat space, the dynamics of edge modes in gauge theory and gravity, and the thermodynamics of horizons. I received a PhD in theoretical physics from Harvard in 2022, under the sage tutelage of Andy Strominger. Before that I received a bachelorâ€™s degree in physics from Caltech in 2016, and before that I was a curious kid.

My interests outside of academia include sports, guitar, music, concerts, cooking, craft beer, reading, and hanging out with friends and loved ones.
